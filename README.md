# Python3 Lib `tw`

This is a very insignificant library I personally use for PDF generation but I think it is not worth to be published on PIP but you might find it usefuly anyways.

# Dependencies

Of course and only `reportlab`.

# Example

It is brutally simple. Have `reportlab` installed of course.



# Installation
